clean-data
==========

To create a new output file from the source ensure that:
* The working directory is set to the root of this file
* The file `run_analysis.R` is in the working directory
* A folder names "UCI HAR Dataset" is in the working directory
* The folder must contain the text files from the zip file `getdata-projectfiles-UCI HAR Dataset.zip`

Run the analysis with the command: **source**("run_analysis.R")

After the file completes a file named `tidy_data.txt` will be in the working directory. 

See the `CodeBook.md` file for a description of the workflow that creates the output file.
