Introduction
--------------------------------------------------------
The file run_analysis.R can be used to create analyze the source files as obtained from the URL [http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones). The source data was created by using data test subjects wearing smartphones and logging all the movements for. By videotaping the subjects it was possible to link each movement made by the test subjects to exact measurements from the smartphones. 

Analysis
--------------------------------------------------------
The goal of the analysis is to combine the source datasets and to link each measurement with an acitivity. After this it is required to create a dataset with a mean value per subject, activity and the measurements. 

Packages
